# image-visualizer

Test the app at:  https://image-sorting-visualizer.herokuapp.com/

The app is just the visualization of sorthing algorithms and how they work. I know they are many apps like this but I decided to create my own just so I can learn more about sorting, time complexity and just get a good feel for it all. 

To start the app you can simply follow the classic Vue.js steps. 

```
npm install
npm run serve
npm run build //in case you are building for production
```

# Usage

1. Find the image online, and copy it's address
2. Paste the image address and choose the number of rows and cols you want to slice the image with. (keep in mind the more you place, the longer will algorithms run.. I would suggest an upper bound of 10x10)  
(The image will shuffle itself based on rows and cols you entered)
3. Choose a sorthing algorithm
4. Observe! üèÅ
